ver 1.1.0

10/10/06 Eliminated out of date documentation.  Need to develop a
Vignette for the package.  This is High on the TODO list

9/29/06 Tried to make rmetasim function names more consistent by
appending 'lansdscape' to the front of them.  This should reduce
naming collision problems with base and other packages in R

3/25/06 Fixed bug in conversion between rmetasim objects and internal
c++ representations.  Added code to parse Arlequin files into rmetasim
objects

3/25/06 IMPORTANT!!! Added three columns to individuals object between
the demographic information and the genetic information.  They store
an individuals unique ID, it's mothers unique ID and fathers unique
ID.  This can be used to track family structure over multiple
generations.  Right now, rmetasim does nothing but create and assign
these IDs properly.  This change alters the text file structure of
rmetasim and will have dire repurcussions for anyone who directly
accesses the individual objects and does not account for the addtional
three columns.  All of the rmetasim functions should work correctly.

If individuals are created outside of the c++ backend, they should be
given appropriate IDs Zero for mother and father indicates individuals
created de novo

Several new functions have been defined to work with these objects.
